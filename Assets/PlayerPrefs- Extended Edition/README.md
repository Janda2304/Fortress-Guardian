# Unity-Engine-PlayerPrefs---Extended-Edition
an extended (wrapped up) version of unity engine built-in PlayerPrefs that extends it's functionality even more

## Description
### Simple wrapper for unity built-in PlayerPrefs class allowing easier saving of certain variables to it.


## Features

#### SetVector3/GetVector3 functions for easier saving of Vector3
#### SetVector3/GetVector2 functions for easier saving of Vector2
#### SetBool/GetBool functions for easier saving of booleans


### Manual
Place the PlayerPrefs - Extended Edition Folder somewhere into your project, as it is just a simple script it does not depend on where it is located.





### Additional Info 

Built-in Unity PlayerPrefs are still usable by using UnityEngine.PlayerPrefs, but this wrapper contains all of the built-in PlayerPrefs functions so it is kinda irrelevant to use the built-in one.

This Script was tested in editor version 2021.3.10f1 and 2021.2.7f1 but it will propably work in older versions unless you are using like 2013 version of Unity Engine.
