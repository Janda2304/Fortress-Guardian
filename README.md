# Fortress Guardian
- ## a tower defense game, but better
- #### i'll maybe even release it sometime (i'm not going to)
- #### it's played from first person and it should be packed with lore but i'm too lazy to implement it in a nice smooth way so no lore for now
- #### the version in this repo is super super old, please don't play it and rather wait for the full release
- #### (i know that the code is messy, it has been fixed already :) )
- ### please support me on my [itch.io](https://janda2304.itch.io)
